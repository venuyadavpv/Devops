# **CI/CD - DevOps Interview Questions**  

## **Beginner Level (1-20 Questions)**  

### **1. What is CI/CD in DevOps?**  

**Answer:**  
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)**.  

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository, and automated tests are run to catch issues early.  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automates the deployment of software.  
  - **Continuous Delivery:** Requires manual approval before deployment.  
  - **Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated, no manual intervention.  

### **2. What are the benefits of using CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Faster Releases:** Automates software delivery.  
- **Early Bug Detection:** Runs tests automatically on new code.  
- **Improved Collaboration:** Developers merge code frequently, reducing integration issues.  
- **Consistent Deployments:** Eliminates manual errors with automated builds and releases.  

### **3. What are some popular CI/CD tools?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Jenkins** – Open-source, highly customizable.  
- **GitHub Actions** – Integrated with GitHub.  
- **GitLab CI/CD** – Built-in with GitLab.  
- **CircleCI, Travis CI** – Cloud-based solutions.  
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline** – Cloud-native CI/CD.  

### **4. What is a CI pipeline?**  

**Answer:**  
A **CI pipeline** is an automated workflow that builds, tests, and validates new code before merging it into production.  

- Steps: **Code Commit → Build → Test → Artifact Storage → Deployment**  
- Example tools: **Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions YAML, GitLab CI/CD YAML**  

### **5. What is a build artifact in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A **build artifact** is a compiled and packaged version of code ready for deployment.  

- Examples:  
  - **JAR, WAR, or ZIP files** for Java projects  
  - **Docker images** for containerized applications  

### **6. How does source control work in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Source control (e.g., **Git**) helps track changes in code.  

- Developers push code to repositories (**GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket**).  
- CI/CD tools trigger **automated builds and tests** on new commits.  

### **7. What is the purpose of unit tests in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Unit tests validate **individual components of code** to catch early-stage bugs.  

- Tools: **JUnit, pytest, Mocha, Jest**  
- Example:  

  ```python
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
  
  def test_add():
      assert add(2, 3) == 5
  ```  

### **8. What is versioning in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Versioning assigns unique numbers to each software release to track changes.  

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., **1.2.3**)  
- **Git Tags:** CI/CD pipelines deploy specific versions using tags.  

### **9. What is a rollback in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A rollback reverts to a previous stable release when the new deployment fails.  

- Example: Rolling back an application using Kubernetes:  

  ```sh
  kubectl rollout undo deployment my-app
  ```  

### **10. What is a canary deployment?**  

**Answer:**  
Canary deployment releases new changes to a **subset of users** before full deployment.  

- Example: **Deploy to 10% of users → Monitor logs → Full release**

A **release train** is a deployment strategy where software releases are scheduled at **fixed intervals**, rather than waiting for all features to be ready.  

- Common in **Agile** environments.  
- Ensures **predictability** and **reduces deployment risks**.  
- Example: **Google Chrome** releases every 4 weeks regardless of pending features.  

### **52. How do you handle database migrations in a CI/CD pipeline?**  

**Answer:**  
Database migrations ensure **schema changes** are applied safely in an automated pipeline.  

- Use tools like **Liquibase, Flyway, Django Migrations**.  
- Steps in CI/CD:  
  1. **Check migrations** before deployment (`liquibase validate`).  
  2. **Apply migrations** during deployment (`flyway migrate`).  
  3. **Rollback if failure** (`flyway undo`).  
- Example in a pipeline (Flyway):  

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Apply database migrations
      run: flyway migrate -url=jdbc:mysql://db -user=root -password=secret
  ```  

### **53. What is trunk-based development, and how does it impact CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Trunk-based development means developers **commit directly to the main branch** (trunk) instead of using long-lived feature branches.  

- **Pros:**  
  - **Faster CI/CD cycles** with fewer merge conflicts.  
  - Reduces integration complexity.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires **strict automated testing** to prevent breaking changes.  
- Example workflow:  
  - Commit to `main` → Automated Tests → Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production.  

### **54. How do you implement blue-green deployments in Kubernetes?**  

**Answer:**  
A **blue-green deployment** runs **two versions** of an application simultaneously, allowing **instant rollback** if issues occur.  

- Steps:  
  1. Deploy **new version (green)** while **old version (blue) stays live**.  
  2. Switch traffic to green using a **load balancer or Ingress**.  
  3. Rollback if issues arise by redirecting traffic back to blue.  
- Example Kubernetes YAML:  

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: blue-green
  spec:
    rules:
      - http:
          paths:
            - path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: green-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
  ```  

### **55. What is a service mesh, and how does it help CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
A **service mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling **service-to-service communication** in microservices.  

- Examples: **Istio, Linkerd, Consul**.  
- Benefits in CI/CD:  
  - **Canary deployments**: Route traffic gradually.  
  - **A/B Testing**: Split traffic between versions.  
  - **Security**: Implements zero-trust policies (e.g., **mTLS**).  

### **56. What is progressive delivery in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Progressive delivery is an **evolution of CI/CD** that deploys features gradually, rather than all at once.  

- **Includes:**  
  - **Feature Flags:** Enable/disable features dynamically.  
  - **Canary Releases:** Test with a small user group first.  
  - **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions for analytics.  

### **57. How do you handle long-running tests in CI/CD pipelines?**  

**Answer:**  
Long-running tests slow down deployments. Strategies to optimize:  

- **Parallel Test Execution:** Run tests across multiple machines.  
- **Test Selection:** Run only impacted tests using **test impact analysis**.  
- **Mocking Dependencies:** Reduce external calls using **Mockito, WireMock**.  
- **Shift-Left Testing:** Run tests **early in the pipeline** to detect failures faster.  

### **58. What is Chaos Engineering, and how does it fit into CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Chaos Engineering involves **intentionally injecting failures** to test system resilience.  

- **Example tools:**  
  - **Gremlin, LitmusChaos** (Kubernetes-based).  
  - **AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)**.  
- **In CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  - Add a **chaos test stage** before production deployment.  
  - Example:  

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Run Chaos Test
        run: gremlin attack --target kubernetes --cpu 90%
    ```  

### **59. How do you implement immutable deployments in CI/CD?**  

**Answer:**  
Immutable deployments mean **never modifying running instances**—instead, deploying a new version entirely.  

- Best for **containers, serverless, and cloud-native applications**.  
- Tools:  
  - **Docker images** (`image: my-app:v2`).  
  - **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)** to replace instances.  
- **Example:**  
  - **Bad approach:** `ssh into a server & update the app`.  
  - **Good approach:** `Deploy a new container & replace old one`.  

### **60. What are the best practices for securing CI/CD pipelines?**  

**Answer:**  
To secure CI/CD, follow **these best practices**:  
✅ **Use Secret Management:** Store secrets in **Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets**.  
✅ **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict who can trigger deployments.  
✅ **Enforce Code Signing:** Sign artifacts to ensure they are not tampered with.  
✅ **Run Security Scans:** Use **SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning** tools.  
✅ **Monitor CI/CD Pipelines:** Detect suspicious activity using **SIEM tools** like Splunk or Datadog.
