# **Cloud - DevOps Interview Questions**  

## **Beginner Level (1-20 Questions)**  

### **1. What is cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet. It eliminates the need for owning and maintaining physical hardware, allowing users to access scalable resources on a pay-as-you-go model.  

### **2. What are the different types of cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Cloud computing is classified into three types:  

- **Public Cloud:** Services provided by third-party vendors like AWS, Azure, and GCP, accessible over the internet.  
- **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a provider.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.  

### **3. What are the benefits of cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Scalability:** Resources can be easily scaled up or down.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** No need to invest in physical hardware.  
- **Flexibility:** Access from anywhere using the internet.  
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cloud providers offer backup and recovery solutions.  

### **4. What are the different cloud service models?**  

**Answer:**  

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines).  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a managed environment for application development (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine).  
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce).  

### **5. What is serverless computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Serverless computing allows developers to run applications without managing underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider dynamically allocates resources as needed. Examples include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.  

### **6. What is virtualization in cloud computing?**  

**Answer:**  
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of servers, storage, or networks. It enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, improving resource utilization.

- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers to distribute the load.  

### **10. What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?**  

**Answer:**  
An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center within a cloud provider's region, designed for fault tolerance and high availability.  

### **11. What is the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud security?**  

**Answer:**  
Cloud providers and customers share security responsibilities:

### **23. What are Reserved Instances in AWS?**  

**Answer:**  
Reserved Instances (RIs) are a pricing model in AWS where users commit to a specific instance type for **1 or 3 years** in exchange for significant discounts (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.  

- **Types of RIs:**
  - **Standard RIs** – Best discounts, but limited flexibility.  
  - **Convertible RIs** – Can switch to another instance type.

**Mitigation strategies:**  

- Use **multi-cloud** strategies to distribute workloads.  
- Adopt **open-source** and **portable** tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform).  
- Design applications with **cloud-agnostic architectures** using containerization and microservices.  

### **55. What is Kubernetes pod affinity and anti-affinity?**  

**Answer:**  
Pod affinity and anti-affinity define rules for **where Kubernetes pods should be scheduled** based on labels.  

- **Pod Affinity:** Ensures pods are scheduled together (e.g., for performance reasons).  
- **Pod Anti-Affinity:** Ensures pods are placed on different nodes (e.g., for high availability).  
- **Example YAML:**  

  ```yaml
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
