## **🚀 Beginner-Level Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Questions (1-20)**

#### *(Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation)*

### **Terraform Questions**  

### **1. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why is it important?**  

**Answer:**  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a **method of managing and provisioning infrastructure** using code instead of manual processes. It allows:  
✅ **Automation** of infrastructure deployment  
✅ **Consistency** by reducing human errors  
✅ **Scalability** through repeatable scripts  

---

### **2. What is Terraform and how does it work?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform is an **open-source IaC tool** by HashiCorp that helps define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. It follows three steps:  

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure in `.tf` files  
2. **Plan**: Preview changes before applying  
3. **Apply**: Deploy and manage resources  

Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

---

### **3. What is the difference between Terraform and Ansible?**  

**Answer:**  

| Feature | Terraform | Ansible |

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

---

### **5. What is a Terraform State File?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform maintains infrastructure details in a **state file (`terraform.tfstate`)**, which:  
✅ Tracks existing resources  
✅ Enables incremental changes  
✅ Supports remote storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob)  

To store state remotely:  

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
  key    = "terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

---

### **6. What is the purpose of `terraform init`?**  

**Answer:**

✅ Setting up backend storage  
✅ Validating configuration  

Command:  

```sh
terraform init
```

---

### **7. How does Terraform manage dependencies between resources?**  

**Answer:**  
Terraform uses **implicit and explicit dependencies**:  

- **Implicit:** Recognized automatically  
- **Explicit:** Defined using `depends_on`  

Example:  

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "data" {
  size          = 10
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  depends_on    = [aws_instance.web]
}
```
